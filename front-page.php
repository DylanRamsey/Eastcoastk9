                Gabbie was very flexible to schedule grooming appointments for my two dogs. She exceeded my expectations and loved her work! She did a wonderful job, and made sure to keep me updated during the process. She was attentive to my dogs and made it comfortable for them since this was their time at a groomers. I will continue to use her for any grooming, and boarding needed. I highly recommend her!

              Gabrielle is the sweetest dog handler I have ever seen! She had such a gentle, loving way with our pup and I'm so glad to have found her. Our puppy had a very bad nail clipping experience at a Veterinarian's office last fall and for months has been snarling with every touch of her feet. Gabby sweet-talked our girl (and plied her with tasty treats!) into letting her clip all of her nails. SUCH a positive experience!

          Our newly renovated boarding facility includes 4 x 6 suites, peaceful music, pet friendly and relaxing essential oils, and two yards for play and exercise.
Temperament evaluations are always completed to be sure each pet is safe to play in a group setting. Our goal is for all dogs in the play groups to have as much fun as possible
interacting with others of similar age and size.
In the warmer months we offer water zones to cool off so you can fully anticipate him/her getting down and dirty! All dogs go home bathed and cleaned if they enjoy the waterworks!
We love to keep you updated throughout your pet's stay so be prepared for pictures and text messages!

*we also offer more advanced grooming for boarding dogs. Please ask about that if you have any questions*
