# East Coast K9
### Version 2

This is a custom WordPress site theme for a dog training business.

## Live Website: http://eastcoastk9fl.com/
## Github Repository: https://github.com/DylanRamsey/east-coast-k9

This directory can be zipped and uploaded as a theme to WordPress, however it was not designed to be used outside of this site build.

This theme uses the Advanced Custom Fields(ACF) Pro plugin for the CMS backend. 

### SCSS code was written to follow AIR BNB style guiding
[Airbnb SCSS Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css) 

### Some custom style guiding I follow ontop of this:
- Font sizes in REMS
- Media queries in REMS

### Some custom code organizion I follow:
- CSS Properties ABC order (Unless it does not make sense to, like screen size breaks being in order from mobile first)

Styling is adding in assets/sass

The SASS will compile to the style.css file for wordpress. Do not edit this file directly, the SASS file will overwrite it. 

Setup SASS to watch for updates and compile to style.css
- npm install -g sass
- sass --watch ./assets/sass/main.scss style.css
