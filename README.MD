# Eastcoastk9

This is a custom WordPress site theme for a dog training business.

Live Website: http://eastcoastk9fl.com/
Github Repository: https://github.com/DylanRamsey/east-coast-k9

This directory can be zipped and uploaded as a theme to WordPress, however it was not designed to be used outside of this site build.

This theme uses the Advanced Custom Fields(ACF) plugin for the CMS backend. 

While component based design was used for this website, the components and set statically because the standard, non paid
version of ACF was used for this theme. 

HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript were written to follow AIR BNB style guiding
https://github.com/airbnb/css
https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

Some custom style guiding I follow ontop of this:
Font sizes and media queries in REMS

Some custom code organizion I follow:
CSS Properties ABC order

Styling is adding in assets/sass
The SASS will compile to the style.css file for wordpress. Do not edit this file directly, the SASS file will overwrite it. 

Setup SASS to watch for updates and compile to style.css
npm install -g sass
sass --watch ./assets/sass/main.scss style.css 

Plugins Used:
Classic Editor
Contact Form 7
SVG Support
Advanced Custom Fields
