# Eastcoastk9

This is a custom WordPress site theme for a dog training business.

## Live Website: http://eastcoastk9fl.com/
## Github Repository: https://github.com/DylanRamsey/east-coast-k9

This directory can be zipped and uploaded as a theme to WordPress, however it was not designed to be used outside of this site build.

This theme uses the Advanced Custom Fields(ACF) plugin for the CMS backend. 

While component based design was used for this website, the components are set statically because the standard, non paid
version of ACF was used for this theme. 

This also means some files are a bit repetitively, because there was no repeat/loop field available for use with the non paid version of ACF.  

### SCSS code was written to follow AIR BNB style guiding
[Airbnb SCSS Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css) 

### Some custom style guiding I follow ontop of this:
Font sizes and media queries in REMS

### Some custom code organizion I follow:
CSS Properties ABC order

Styling is adding in assets/sass

The SASS will compile to the style.css file for wordpress. Do not edit this file directly, the SASS file will overwrite it. 

Setup SASS to watch for updates and compile to style.css
- npm install -g sass
- sass --watch ./assets/sass/main.scss style.css 

### Plugins Used:
- Classic Editor
- Contact Form 7
- SVG Support
- Advanced Custom Fields
